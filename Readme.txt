ID3 Algorithm for Decision Tree Implementation designed in Python
Class Value is considered to be the first column in the training and test data sets
It accepts three inputs files : training data set, test data set and attribute mapping file

System Requirements to run : python 3.5.0
Command to run: 
	Navigate to the path where python files are present
	type : python decisionTree.py "train_data_set" "test_data_set" "attribute_mapping_file"
	It will print the tree with accuracy in training set as well as test data set
	Output file will be generated containing predicted class_value with its correctness
